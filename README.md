# MigrateContacts

## Guidelines:

- Rename the file containing the list of enrollees to `enrollees_list.xlsx` and place it in the data dir.
- Do not change the `output_template.xlsx` file if unsure.
- Import `contacts.csv` into Google Contacts.

## Steps for use:

- Ensure you have Python installed and paths to the Python exec and pip added to the Path variable.
- Clone the repo.
- Run `migrate-contacts.py`

# Note
